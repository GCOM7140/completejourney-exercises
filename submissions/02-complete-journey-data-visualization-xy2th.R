#Q4 Building on Question 3, suppose you want to understand whether the retailer's customers' preference for national brands (compared to private-label brands) is stronger in the soft drink category than it is in the cheese category. Examine this supposition by using a stacked bar chart to compare the split between national and private-label brands for soft drinks and cheeses.
